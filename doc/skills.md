# Skills

## Ironflesh

Type: `personal`. Attribute: `strength`. Increases hit points by 2. Maximum of 20 additional hit points. Not very useful skill because two points per level is just too low. Plus, most of the time, your armor is what will be keeping you alive in a late game. I don't recommend investing into this, instead buy a better armor. This skill doesn't increase survivability that much.

## Power Strike

Type: `personal`. Attribute: `strength`. Increases melee damage by 8%. Maximum of 80% more damage. An essential skill for melee combat regardless whether by foot or horse. This skill makes killing your enemies easier and faster. Level 5 minimum is recommended to achieve. Even if for archer builds, I still think you need to put a few points into this so that you can handle yourself in melee combat.

## Power Throw

Type: `personal`. Attribute: `strength`. Increases throwing damage by 10%. Some thrown weapons require a few points in Power Throw to use (e.g. axes, javelins). Maximum of 100% more damage. As I've sad before, throwing weapons are not very viable in vanilla. If you want to go for range pick either bow or crossbow. Power Draw even increases damage by 14% compared to this skill's 10%. But if you still want to go for a thrower warrior, then of course, this is what will help with that style.

# Power Draw

Type: `personal`. Attribute: `strength`. Power Draw adds 14% to each hit with the bow, until four levels beyond the bowâ€™s minimum Power Draw requirement. Also higher Power Draw makes powerful bows easier to use by improving your accuracy. If you want to be an archer make sure you have at least 5 points into this. I recommend bumping it up to level 7 and then you can basically one shot almost all the enemy units. The best bows in the game require level 4 or 5. Archers with big power draw can deal massive damage.
