## Ironflesh

Type: `personal`. Attribute: `strength`. Increases hit points by 2. Maximum of 20 additional hit points. Not very useful skill because two points per level is just too low. Plus, most of the time, your armor is what will be keeping you alive in a late game. I don't recommend investing into this, instead buy a better armor. This skill doesn't increase survivability that much.
