# Skills

## Ironflesh

Type: `personal`. Attribute: `strength`. Increases hit points by 2. Maximum of 20 additional hit points. Not very useful skill because two points per level is just too low. Plus, most of the time, your armor is what will be keeping you alive in a late game. I don't recommend investing into this, instead buy a better armor. This skill doesn't increase survivability that much.

## Power Strike

Type: `personal`. Attribute: `strength`. Increases melee damage by 8%. Maximum of 80% more damage. An essential skill for melee combat regardless whether by foot or horse. This skill makes killing your enemies easier and faster. Level 5 minimum is recommended to achieve. Even if for archer builds, I still think you need to put a few points into this so that you can handle yourself in melee combat.
