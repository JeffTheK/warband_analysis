# Skills

## Ironflesh

Type: `personal`. Attribute: `strength`. Increases hit points by 2. Maximum of 20 additional hit points. Not very useful skill because two points per level is just too low. Plus, most of the time, your armor is what will be keeping you alive in a late game. I don't recommend investing into this, instead buy a better armor. This skill doesn't increase survivability that much.

## Power Strike

Type: `personal`. Attribute: `strength`. Increases melee damage by 8%. Maximum of 80% more damage. An essential skill for melee combat regardless whether by foot or horse. This skill makes killing your enemies easier and faster. Level 5 minimum is recommended to achieve. Even if for archer builds, I still think you need to put a few points into this so that you can handle yourself in melee combat.

## Power Throw

Type: `personal`. Attribute: `strength`. Increases throwing damage by 10%. Some thrown weapons require a few points in Power Throw to use (e.g. axes, javelins). Maximum of 100% more damage. As I've sad before, throwing weapons are not very viable in vanilla. If you want to go for range pick either bow or crossbow. Power Draw even increases damage by 14% compared to this skill's 10%. But if you still want to go for a thrower warrior, then of course, this is what will help with that style.

## Power Draw

Type: `personal`. Attribute: `strength`. Power Draw adds 14% to each hit with the bow, until four levels beyond the bow’s minimum Power Draw requirement. Also higher Power Draw makes powerful bows easier to use by improving your accuracy. If you want to be an archer make sure you have at least 5 points into this. I recommend bumping it up to level 7 and then you can basically one shot almost all the enemy units. The best bows in the game require level 4 or 5. Archers with big power draw can deal massive damage.

## Weapon Master

Type: `personal`. Attribute: `agility`. Adds 40 points to your weapon proficiency limits. Beyond this limit, you cannot increase weapon proficiencies by investing points into them. Weapon proficiencies can also be increased with practice, even beyond the limit set by Weapon Mastery, but the rate of increase will slow down as you get further from the limit. You can easily skip this one, but I still think you can have at least 3 points just to make the weapons better and faster. Probably the second most important skill for melee after the power strike. If you are an archer, you can live without it and deal with a little bit of less accuracy, since you will have less weapon proficiency. If you imagine yourself being the master of a glorious ancient killing machine like a sword or maybe even a katana, and want to be the best wielder of it, then you can invest a lot of into it.

## Shield

Type: `personal`. Attribute: `agility`. Each point reduces the damage to your shield takes when blocking a hit by 8%. It also increases your shield’s effective size versus ranged attacks and improves how quickly you can block with a shield. Putting more than 3 points into this one is probably useless, but having at least two is good, since shields are the only way to safely avoid enemy projectiles. Even if two handed combat is used, I still suggest to have a shield and one level in this skill.

## Athletics

Type: `personal`. Attribute: `agility`. Increases your base running speed, but not too much. Use this only if you're planning on to fight on foot. Small difference in levels makes this skill not very useful, so much, that I don't recommend to use it at all even if you are a ground fighter.

## Riding

Type: `personal`. Attribute: `agility`. Most horses have a minimum riding requirement; this skill also increases your speed and agility while sitting astride a steed, but only up to a certain point. An essential skill for melee horse fighters. Level up to 4 to be able to ride the fastest horses, you can go one step forward and have the most armored ones. I put at least 4 points into this skill. Useless if you are not planning to utilize them.

## Horse Archery

Type: `personal`. Attribute: `agility`. If horse archery is your thing, then you will absolutely need this skill, since you have penalty for firing while mounted.  Reduces accuracy and damage penalties for using a ranged weapon from a moving horse. Note that no penalties are applied if you are mounted but not moving. If you plan on firing while mounted, then put a few points into this.

## Looting

Type: `party`. Attribute: `agility`. Increases amount looted at villages and after battles by 10%, and decreases the time needed to loot a village. Maximum of 140% more loot including party bonus. Useful skill for making lots of money.
